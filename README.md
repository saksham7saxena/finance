Market Insights Chatbot is a web-based tool that uses OpenAI GPT to answer finance queries, providing real-time stock prices, market trends, and economic indicators through integrated APIs. Designed with React and deployed on AWS, it helps users explore markets interactively and learn key financial concepts.

Users can ask questions like:
"What is Teslaâ€™s current stock price?"
"Explain the concept of inflation in simple terms."
"What was the GDP growth rate of India last year?"

This project is designed as an educational tool, providing market data and insights to anyone curious about financial markets, helping them learn interactively without the need for complex finance tools.
